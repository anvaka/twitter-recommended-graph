# Twitter related graph

This repository contains [a demo](https://twitter.com/anvaka/status/1396546646733848580) for Twitter to show how to render a map of related users.

## How to use it

This code is not supposed to be used, and was created for demo purposes only.

To record the demo I opened developer's console on a twitter user profile mode and 
pasted the code from [dist/run.js](dist/run.js). Then I scrolled the page to trigger the map
loading. 

Check the console for errors/warnings/logs
